## 🪑 Seating Chart

In this course, each student will be assigned a dedicated computer for all in-class work involving AI tools, spreadsheets, and project files.

- You must choose a permanent seat by the end of the first week of class.

- Your assigned device will be tied to your unique login and saved work.

- Once the seating chart is finalized, you must remain in that seat for the rest of the semester.

- Moving to a different computer may result in being unable to access your work or submit assignments.

- This system ensures consistency, security, and fair access to your learning tools.

## 💻 Process for Logging On, Completing Work, and Logging Off Lab Computers

These steps must be followed every time you use your assigned desktop computer in the Data Science Lab.

### 🟢 Logging On
- Go directly to **your assigned computer**.
- **Log in with your unique Windows username and password.**
- **Use only your assigned machine.** Much of your work will be saved locally and cannot be accessed from other computers.

### ✍️ While Working
- Open only the **applications** you are instructed to use.
- If using a browser, **GitHub can be accessed in-browser or installed as a desktop app**.
- Save your files regularly and keep track of where they are stored.
- Use your **Data Science Journal** to take notes or track your work.
- If something goes wrong, **raise your hand** — do not attempt to fix hardware or settings yourself.

### 🔴 Logging Off
- Save and close all files and documents.
- **Sign out of your account at the end of class.**
