# üß† Git vs GitHub: What's the Difference?

## üí° What is **Git**?

**Git** stands for... absolutely nothing!

> It‚Äôs not an acronym ‚Äî just a short, punchy name that [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (the creator of Linux) chose in 2005.

That said, some fun backronyms have been made up like:
- **"Global Information Tracker"**
- Or, jokingly, **"Goddamn Idiotic Truckload of sh\*"** (Linus had a sense of humor)

### üîß So what *is* Git?

Git is a **version control system**.

It helps you:
- Save **snapshots** of your code or work
- **Track changes** over time
- Go **back to earlier versions** if something breaks
- **Collaborate** without overwriting each other

> Think of Git like **Google Docs version history**, but for code and projects ‚Äî and way more powerful.

## üåê What is **GitHub**?

**GitHub** is a **website + cloud service** built around Git.

It lets you:
- Store your Git repositories **online**
- **Collaborate** with others (with issues, pull requests, wikis, etc.)
- Create **classrooms**, manage **assignments**, and review student work
- Show off your code and projects to the world

> Git is like your **local notebook**.  
> GitHub is like **publishing that notebook** to the web and **working with others on it**.

*Want a visual metaphor? Git is your save button. GitHub is your online multiplayer workspace.*
